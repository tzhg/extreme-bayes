	abstract = {Understanding and quantifying the behaviour of a rainfall process at extreme levels has important applications for design in civil engineering. As in the extremal analysis of any environmental process, estimates often are required of the probability of events that are rarer than those already recorded. As data on extremes are scarce, all available sources of information should be used in inference. Consequently, research has focused on the development of techniques that make optimal use of available data. In this paper a daily rainfall series is analysed within a Bayesian framework, illustrating how the careful elicitation of prior expert information can supplement data and lead to improved estimates of extremal behaviour. For example, using the prior knowledge of an expert hydrologist, a Bayesian 95% interval estimate of the 100-year return level for daily rainfall is found to be approximately half of the width of the corresponding likelihood-based confidence interval.},

	abstract = {A simple method for subset selection of independent variables in regression models is proposed. We expand the usual regression equation to an equation that incorporates all possible subsets of predictors by adding indicator variables as parameters. The vector of indicator variables dictates which predictors to include. Several choices of priors can be employed for the unknown regression coefficients and the unknown indicator parameters. The posterior distribution of the indicator vector is approximated by means of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We select subsets with high posterior probabilities. In addition to linear models, we consider generalized linear models.},

	abstract = {The Generalized Pareto (GP) and Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions play an important role in extreme value analyses as models for threshold excesses and block maxima, respectively. For each of these distributions we consider Bayesian inference using "reference" prior distributions (in the general sense of priors constructed using formal rules) for the model parameters, specifically a Jeffreys prior, the maximal data information (MDI) prior and independent uniform priors on separate model parameters. We investigate whether these improper priors lead to proper posterior distributions. We show that, in the GP and GEV cases, the MDI prior, unless modified, never yields a proper posterior and that in the GEV case this also applies to the Jeffreys prior. We also show that a sample size of three (four) is sufficient for independent uniform priors to yield a proper posterior distribution in the GP (GEV) case.},

	abstract = {Extreme value problems are characterized by a scarcity of data and the requirement of modelling where the data are most sparse. This presents a dilemma when considering a Bayesian approach to inference: the value of additional prior information is likely to be substantial, but the plausibility of formulating such prior knowledge for extremal behaviour is questionable. In this paper we review the literature linking the themes of Bayesian and extreme value analysis, and use recent advances in Bayesian computational tools to assess the utility of a Bayesian extreme value analysis in three different situations: one where an expert is available to supply prior information; the second where maximum likelihood fails; and the third where spatial information on related variables is used to formulate an empirical prior. /// Les problèmes des valeurs extrèmes sont caractérisées par la pénurie des données et par l'exigence de modèlisation où les données sont le plus clairsemées. Ce fait devient un vrai dilemme quand on abord l'inférence d'une manière Baysienne: le valeur des renseignements antérieurs est probablement important, mais il nést pas du tout certain qu'on peut bien appliquer ces renseignements aux valeurs extrèmes. Dans cet article nous passons en revue la littérature qui relie les thèmes de l'analyse Baysienne et de l'analyse des valeurs extrèmes, et utilisons des avances récents en outils informatiques Bayesiens pour juger la valeur d'analyse Bayesien des valeurs extrèmes en trois situations différents: premièrement, où un expert est disponible pour fournir des renseignements antérieurs; deuxièmement, où 'maximum likelihood' échoue; et troisièmement, où on utilise des renseignements en espace sur des variables liées pour formuler un 'empirical prior'.},
